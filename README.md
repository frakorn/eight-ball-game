# Eightball

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.2.

## Development server

This is a simulation based on the 8 ball pool game.
The application takes in input three configuration files (config.json,match.json,timestamps.json).

- config.json: it contains the list of pockets, the list of balls and the list of players.
- match.json: it contains the pairing between players and pockets
- timestamps: it contains the pairing between timestamp and ball

Use `src/assets/data` to edit configuration files by yourself.
